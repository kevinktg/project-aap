# Project Brief

## Project Overview
**Next.js 15 + GSAP Starter** is a production-ready web development template optimized specifically for AI-assisted development using Cline and Kilo Code. This project combines the latest web technologies with comprehensive AI assistant optimization to create a powerful foundation for building modern, animated websites.

## Primary Goals
1. **AI Assistant Optimization**: Provide comprehensive rules, context, and documentation that enables Cline and Kilo Code to work effectively with the codebase
2. **Modern Web Stack**: Leverage Next.js 15, React 19, GSAP 3.12.7, and TypeScript for cutting-edge web development
3. **Performance First**: Implement best practices for web performance, SEO, and user experience
4. **Developer Experience**: Create an exceptional development workflow with proper tooling and automation

## Target Audience
- **Web Developers** using AI assistants for faster development
- **Agencies** building client websites with modern animation requirements
- **Solo Developers** seeking a professional, well-structured starting point
- **Teams** wanting consistent, AI-friendly development standards

## Key Features
- **Modular .clinerules System**: Dynamic rule management with active/inactive rule organization
- **Memory Bank Integration**: Persistent context across AI assistant sessions
- **GSAP Animation Library**: Pre-built animation components and utilities with React integration
- **TypeScript Everything**: Full type safety across the entire application
- **Modern Tooling**: ESLint, Prettier, Husky, and lint-staged for code quality
- **VS Code Optimization**: Complete workspace configuration for optimal development experience

## Project Scope
This is a **starter template/boilerplate** project designed to be:
